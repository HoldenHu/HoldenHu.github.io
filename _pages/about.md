Hi, Welcome to my personal website. I'm currently a third year Ph.D. candidate in **School of Computing, National University of Singapore.**   
I'm currently the member of **[Web Information Retrieval / Natural Language Processing Group (WING)](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/)** and uner supervision of associate professor Dr. **[Min-yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/)**. My current research interest lies in `graph neural network` and `recommendation system`.    

Previously, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in [software engineering](https://sw.scu.edu.cn/) from **[Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/)**.
